## Unweaver
NOTE: Unweaver is still in *early* development! It is largely incomplete and compatibility with other mods is **not yet** tested!
Use with caution!

Unweaver is an API that exposes interfaces and registries to extend functions that vanilla Minecraft outright hardcoded in the game.
This included enums, hardcoded condition checks, fixed strings, etc.

Features currently supported can be found [here](https://github.com/ConcernCraft/unweaver/wiki/Currently-Implemented-Features).
Want a new feature? Open a new issue on the issue tracker. :)

### How to use
Jitpack is coming soonâ„¢. Until then please pester me via DM or in Fabricord. (`@leocth#3409`)
